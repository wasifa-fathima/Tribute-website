          <h2>Mission Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b> 15 October 1931-27 July
            2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as
            the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
            raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation and Indian Space Research Organisation and
            was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
            military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as
            the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
            ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a
            pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
            nuclear test by India in 1974.
